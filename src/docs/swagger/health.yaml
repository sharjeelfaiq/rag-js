    System health monitoring and status reporting API for application infrastructure monitoring.

    **Health Status Levels:**
    - `healthy`: All systems operational (database connected, memory normal)
    - `degraded`: System operational with issues (database error or high memory)

    **Monitoring Components:**
    - Database connectivity and response time
    - Memory usage monitoring (threshold: 500MB)
    - Configuration validation for external services
    - Environment and system diagnostics

    **Use Cases:**
    - Load balancer health checks
    - Monitoring system integration
    - DevOps troubleshooting and diagnostics
    - Service uptime verification

      summary: Check basic system health (public)
      description: |
        Performs basic health checks on system components and returns simplified status information.
        This endpoint is publicly accessible and does not require authentication.

        **Health Checks Performed:**
        - Database connectivity using mongoose ping
        - Memory usage monitoring (500MB threshold)

        **Health Logic:**
        - `healthy`: Database status is "healthy" AND memory status is "normal"
        - `degraded`: Database has errors/disconnected OR memory usage is high

        **Response:**
        Always returns HTTP 200 with health status in the response body.

      summary: Check detailed system health (private)
      description: |
        Performs comprehensive health checks on all system components and returns detailed status information.
        This endpoint requires authentication and provides extensive diagnostic information.

        **Health Checks Performed:**
        - Database connectivity using mongoose ping with response time
        - Memory usage monitoring (500MB threshold)
        - Configuration validation for external services
        - System uptime and environment information

        **Health Logic:**
        - `healthy`: Database status is "healthy" AND memory status is "normal"
        - `degraded`: Database has errors/disconnected OR memory usage is high

        **Response Codes:**
        - `200`: System is healthy (all checks passed)
        - `503`: System is degraded (at least one check failed)

        **Configuration Checks:**
        Validates presence of required environment variables:
        - `DATABASE_URI`: Database connection string
        - `JWT_SECRET_KEY`: JWT signing secret
        - `CLOUDINARY_*`: Cloud storage configuration (3 variables)
        - `USER_EMAIL` & `USER_PASSWORD`: Email service credentials

        **Environment URLs:**
        Returns appropriate URLs based on NODE_ENV:
