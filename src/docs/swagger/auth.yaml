        - Must provide valid JWT token in Authorization header
        - Token is validated via middleware before processing

        **Security:**
        - Token is added to blacklist to prevent reuse
        - Blacklisted tokens expire automatically after 1 hour
        - Returns error if token is already blacklisted

        **Implementation Notes:**
        - Token is extracted from Authorization header by removing "Bearer " prefix
        - Blacklist check performed before adding to prevent duplicate entries

        **Security:**
