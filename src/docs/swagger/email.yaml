        - Email Verification
      summary: Verify email address with token
      description: |
        Validates the email verification token and activates the user account.

        ## Process Flow
        1. Decodes and validates the JWT verification token from query parameter
        2. Extracts `id` from token payload
        3. Updates user's `isEmailVerified` status to `true`
        4. Sends verification notification email
        5. Returns HTML verification success page

        ## Token Requirements
        - Valid JWT format signed with system secret
        - Contains `id` field with valid MongoDB ObjectId
        - Must not be expired (10 minute expiration)

        ## Response Format
        Returns HTML content (not JSON) for browser display with login redirect link.
      operationId: check-verification-token

        - $ref: "#/components/parameters/VerificationTokenQuery"

        - Email Verification
      summary: Send verification email
      description: |
        Sends a verification email containing a secure JWT token to the specified email address.

        ## Process Flow
        1. Validates that a user exists with the provided email
        2. Generates JWT verification token containing user ID (10 minute expiration)
        3. Sends HTML verification email via Nodemailer with subject "Welcome - Verify your email"
        4. Returns JSON success response

        ## Error Handling
        If token generation or email sending fails, the user account is automatically 
        deleted to prevent orphaned unverified accounts.

        ## Email Template
        Uses HTML template from `views/verification-email/index.html` with dynamic 
        token substitution.
